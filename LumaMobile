You are building an Expo React Native app (TypeScript) named “Luma” (forum client). Phase 1 is OFFLINE ONLY with dummy data and fake auth. Do NOT call any real API yet.

Primary goals (Phase 1):
- Premium UI (“albeni”), polished layout, subtle motion, haptics, bottom-sheets, great typography.
- Public reading without login (feed + post detail + categories).
- Writing requires login (create/edit/delete) BUT auth is fake.
- Theme: default LIGHT with Dark toggle; persist theme selection locally.
- Architecture that makes Phase 2 API integration a drop-in change (repository/adapters).

Tech stack for Phase 1:
- Expo SDK latest stable + TypeScript
- expo-router navigation
- nativewind styling + internal UI kit
- zustand for session + theme
- @tanstack/react-query for data access even in offline mode (so Phase 2 swaps data source easily)
- @shopify/flash-list for feed performance
- dayjs for relative time
- @gorhom/bottom-sheet for category picker and action sheets
- react-native-reanimated (subtle animations)
- expo-haptics (haptics)
- expo-linear-gradient (tasteful brand gradients)
- expo-image (images)
- AsyncStorage for persisting theme + fake session

IMPORTANT: No moderation features in mobile.

========================================
PHASE 1 DATA MODEL (Dummy)
========================================
Create realistic dummy DTOs:
- Category { id, name, slug? }
- Post {
    id, categoryId, categoryName,
    title, body,
    author { id, displayName, avatarUrl? },
    createdAt (ISO string),
    media: { id, url }[],
    isApproved (bool),
    ownerUserId (string)
  }

Dummy logic:
- Public feed shows only isApproved=true posts.
- When a logged-in user creates a post:
  - Store it in local dummy store with isApproved=false.
  - Show success state: “Gönderin alındı, moderatör onayı bekleniyor.”
  - DO NOT show it in public feed (since not approved).
- However, in Profile add a “Benim Gönderilerim” section:
  - show all posts where ownerUserId == currentUserId, including pending.
  - pending posts should have a “Onay bekliyor” badge.

Fake auth:
- Login/register screens exist.
- Accept any non-empty phone + password.
- On login/register:
  - create a fake user { id: uuid, phone, displayName } and store in zustand + AsyncStorage.
- Logout clears it.

Auth gating:
- Feed and Post Details are public.
- Create and Profile require login.
- If unauth user tries to access Create/Profile:
  - redirect to login and return to intended destination after login.

========================================
ALBENI / PREMIUM UX REQUIREMENTS
========================================
Implement:
- Light theme default: warm off-white background, subtle card tint, refined shadows.
- Dark theme: deep charcoal with controlled accent.
- Accent palette: Luma Violet + secondary Teal/Cyan (use sparingly).
- Brand mark: a simple gradient circle logo in header/auth screens.
- Micro-animations:
  - Pressable cards scale to 0.98 + shadow changes
  - Smooth toast entrance/exit
  - Chip selection animation
- Haptics:
  - Light: chip select, theme toggle, successful submit
  - Medium: delete confirm
- Bottom-sheet:
  - category picker in Feed and Create
  - actions sheet for post options (edit/delete) if owner

========================================
SCREENS (Phase 1)
========================================
Navigation (expo-router):
- Auth stack: /(auth)/login, /(auth)/register
- Tabs: /(tabs)/feed, /(tabs)/create, /(tabs)/profile
- Post details: /post/[id]
- Post edit: /post/[id].edit

1) Feed (public)
- Header with “Luma” + subtle gradient accent
- Category filter chips + “Kategori” button opening bottom sheet
- FlashList feed of approved posts only
- Pull-to-refresh (simulated)
- Infinite pagination (simulate cursor by chunking dummy list)
- Skeleton + EmptyState

2) Post Details (public)
- show full post + media gallery
- If logged-in and owner:
  - show Edit + Delete
- If post is pending (isApproved=false) and owner is viewing from Profile list:
  - show “Onay bekliyor” badge

3) Create Post (requires login)
- Form: category, title, body, optional media picker
- Media picker selects local images (do not upload)
- On submit:
  - add post as pending to dummy store
  - show success modal/screen: waiting approval
  - haptic light + toast

4) Edit Post (requires login + owner)
- Allow editing title/body/category/media (local)
- Save updates in dummy store
- toast “Güncellendi”

5) Delete Post (requires login + owner)
- Confirmation modal (medium haptic)
- Delete from dummy store
- Navigate back + toast

6) Profile (requires login)
- user card (displayName/phone)
- theme toggle (persisted)
- “Benim Gönderilerim” list:
  - shows approved + pending
  - pending has badge and is visible only here
- logout

========================================
ARCHITECTURE (Designed for Phase 2 API integration)
========================================

/app
  /(auth)/login.tsx
  /(auth)/register.tsx
  /(tabs)/_layout.tsx
  /(tabs)/feed/index.tsx
  /(tabs)/create/index.tsx
  /(tabs)/profile/index.tsx
  /post/[id].tsx
  /post/[id].edit.tsx
  _layout.tsx

/src
  /data
    dummyDb.ts           // in-memory + persisted storage (posts, categories)
    seeds.ts             // initial dummy data
  /repositories
    postsRepo.ts         // interface + dummy implementation
    categoriesRepo.ts
    authRepo.ts          // fake auth
  /stores
    authStore.ts         // zustand + persistence
    themeStore.ts        // zustand + AsyncStorage persistence
  /queries
    keys.ts
    useFeed.ts
    usePost.ts
    useCategories.ts
    useMyPosts.ts
  /ui
    theme.ts             // tokens for light/dark
    primitives/*         // Button, Input, Card, Tag, Avatar, Skeleton, Toast, Modal, BottomSheet
  /lib
    format.ts
    uuid.ts
    errors.ts
    logger.ts

Key rule:
- UI uses repositories via react-query hooks.
- For Phase 2, we will swap dummy repositories with API repositories without rewriting screens.

========================================
DELIVERABLES
========================================
- Full working Expo codebase with the structure above.
- Runs offline with dummy data.
- Premium visuals + motion + haptics.
- Theme persisted.
- Fake login/register works and gates Create/Profile properly.
- README explaining Phase 1 and how Phase 2 will replace repositories with API adapters.
