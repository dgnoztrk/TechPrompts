You are a senior .NET architect and lead developer. Build a production-grade, single-tenant corporate website foundation (NOT a generator) using ASP.NET Core MVC targeting .NET 10 (use the latest installed stable .NET 10 SDK / TargetFramework accordingly), EF Core, and SQLite. The solution must compile and run. No broken references, missing ViewModels, broken cshtml, or missing DI registrations.

HARD REQUIREMENTS
- Tech: ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 10), EF Core, SQLite
- UI: Bootstrap (latest stable) + jQuery (latest stable) via CDN ONLY
- Theme: single theme, use /wwwroot/css/light.css (minimal but polished corporate styling)
- No file uploads for images (remote URLs only)
- Strict server-side HTML sanitization for all WYSIWYG content (see SANITIZATION section)
- Admin authentication: simple local user table + cookie auth (NO full ASP.NET Identity)
- Localization: TR, EN, RU (public site + admin UI), using ASP.NET Core localization with resource files
- Deployment target: IIS (include IIS-ready settings and notes)

PRIMARY GOAL
Deliver an “actually usable corporate website” with:
1) Public site (multi-language):
   - Home
   - About
   - Services (list + detail)
   - Projects/Portfolio (list + detail)
   - Blog/News (list + detail)
   - Contact (writes to DB)
   - Privacy / KVKK page
   - Search (site-wide: blog + projects + services + pages)
   - Sitemap.xml + robots.txt
   - SEO-friendly URLs by slug, localized slugs supported (or shared slug strategy with localized titles, decide and document)
2) Admin panel (Area: /Admin) with complete CRUD:
   - Dashboard (KPIs: visits optional placeholder, but show counts: messages, drafts, published posts, etc.)
   - Pages (CMS) - WYSIWYG + publish/unpublish + scheduling (optional)
   - Blog/News - categories + tags + WYSIWYG + cover image URL + publish state + date
   - Services - categories + tags + WYSIWYG + icon + ordering + publish state
   - Projects/Portfolio - categories + tags + WYSIWYG + cover image URL + ordering + publish state
   - Site Settings (company name, logo url, social links, contact info, address, map iframe blocked -> use safe embed approach or link-only)
   - Contact Messages - list, detail, status (New/InProgress/Closed), notes
   - Users (local) - create/update/disable, role assignment (Admin/Editor)
   - Media URLs (optional helper table): store reusable remote image URLs with validation
3) Corporate UX & UI quality:
   - Public: responsive navbar, footer with contact/social, hero sections, card layouts, good typography, consistent spacing
   - Admin: sidebar navigation, breadcrumbs, consistent forms, validation summaries, “toast-like” notifications (Bootstrap alerts acceptable), loading states where appropriate
   - Use Bootstrap components properly; keep custom CSS in light.css only

ARCHITECTURE / CODE QUALITY
- Use a maintainable structure. Prefer:
  /src
    /Web (MVC, Areas/Admin, Views, wwwroot)
    /Application (services, DTOs/ViewModels, validation)
    /Domain (entities, enums)
    /Infrastructure (EF Core DbContext, repositories if needed)
  Keep it pragmatic: controllers thin, business logic in services.
- Async EF Core everywhere.
- Use ViewModels/DTOs for web binding. Never bind EF entities directly in POST actions.
- Add server-side validation (DataAnnotations or FluentValidation - choose one and be consistent).
- Add pagination, filtering, sorting for admin lists (category/tag filters included).
- Add concurrency protection where needed (RowVersion or UpdatedAt check) to avoid lost updates.
- Add global exception handling + user-friendly error pages.
- Add structured logging (default ILogger).
- Add health endpoint (e.g., /health) for basic diagnostics.

DATABASE & SQLITE PATHING (CRITICAL)
- SQLite DB file:
  - Development: placed at project root (same folder as .csproj)
  - Published/IIS: placed next to the deployed app (AppContext.BaseDirectory)
- Implement a robust path resolver:
  - If running from source: resolve via Directory.GetCurrentDirectory() and/or locate .csproj directory
  - If running published: use AppContext.BaseDirectory
  - Ensure migrations can be applied.
- Auto-migrate on startup ONLY in Development; in Production provide manual migration step and log warnings if schema mismatch.
- Document the IIS deployment steps and DB placement behavior clearly in README.

AUTH (LOCAL USER TABLE + COOKIE)
- Implement your own local user table:
  - User: Id, Username, PasswordHash, PasswordSalt (or use a strong KDF like PBKDF2/BCrypt), DisplayName, IsActive, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
  - Roles: Admin, Editor (store in table or as claim)
- Use cookie authentication with claims.
- Admin area requires Admin/Editor roles; sensitive actions (users/settings) Admin-only.
- Seed an initial Admin in Development:
  - Read from appsettings.Development.json or environment variables.
  - Never hardcode credentials in source.
  - Log a one-time message in Development if seeding happened.

LOCALIZATION (TR/EN/RU)
- Implement RequestLocalization with cultures: tr-TR, en-US, ru-RU
- Use resource files (.resx) for UI strings (public + admin)
- Provide a language switcher in public navbar and admin topbar
- Persist selection via cookie, fallback to Accept-Language
- Ensure slugs/content: choose one strategy:
  Option A: Single slug per content item, localized title/body.
  Option B: Per-language slug fields (SlugTr, SlugEn, SlugRu) with routing logic.
  Pick ONE and implement fully, document it.

CONTENT / SEO FEATURES (SHOULD HAVE)
- SEO:
  - Meta title/description per page/post/project/service
  - OpenGraph tags (title/description/image) on detail pages
  - Canonical URL
  - Basic JSON-LD for Organization + Article (blog)
- Performance:
  - Bundling not required since CDN, but enable caching headers for light.css and static assets
  - Output caching for public list/detail pages (optional) with invalidation on publish/update
- Accessibility basics:
  - proper aria labels, contrast, form labels, focus states

WYSIWYG EDITOR
- Use Summernote in admin forms.
- Persist HtmlContent fields in DB.
- Render sanitized HTML on public pages ONLY.

SANITIZATION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Implement a server-side sanitizer and tests. Rules:
- Disallow: <script>, <iframe>, <object>, <embed>, <style> (and inline style attributes)
- Remove all event handlers: on* attributes everywhere
- Allow <img> tag but:
  - src must be http/https only
  - prohibit data: and blob: everywhere
  - only allow attributes: src, alt, title
  - if invalid src -> remove the entire img tag (preferred) or strip src making it harmless; choose one and be consistent
- Allow <a> but:
  - href http/https only
  - add rel="noopener noreferrer" and target="_blank" optionally (decide and document)
- Allow common formatting tags:
  p, br, strong, em, b, i, u, ul, ol, li, h1-h6, blockquote, code, pre
  optional table tags (table, thead, tbody, tr, th, td) if safe
- Provide unit tests with malicious payloads:
  - javascript: URLs
  - data: and blob:
  - onerror/onload
  - mixed casing & encoded payloads
  - nested tags attempting bypass
- Also implement a strict RemoteUrlValidator for:
  - CoverImageUrl, img src, social/logo URLs
  - enforce http/https
  - optional allowlist domains (do NOT enforce unless configured)

CDN REQUIREMENTS (LATEST STABLE)
- Add Bootstrap and jQuery from official CDNs (jsDelivr or official recommended).
- Use integrity + crossorigin where available.
- Keep versions in one place (e.g., _Layout constants or config) but since CDN, hardcode stable versions and document how to update.

ENTITY MODEL (BASELINE)
Implement entities with categories + tags:
- Category: Id, Name, Slug, Type (Blog/Service/Project), SortOrder, IsActive
- Tag: Id, Name, Slug
- Page: Id, Culture-aware fields (depending on strategy), Title, HtmlContent, IsPublished, SeoTitle, SeoDescription, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
- BlogPost: Id, Title, Summary, HtmlContent, CoverImageUrl, IsPublished, PublishedAt, Categories (many-to-many), Tags (many-to-many), CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
- Service: Id, Title, ShortDescription, HtmlContent, IconCssClass, IsPublished, SortOrder, Categories, Tags, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
- Project: Id, Title, Summary, HtmlContent, CoverImageUrl, IsPublished, SortOrder, Categories, Tags, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
- SiteSetting: Id, Key, Value, Group
- ContactMessage: Id, Name, Email, Subject, Message, CreatedAt, Status, AdminNote
- LocalUser: Id, Username, PasswordHash, PasswordSalt, Role, IsActive, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt

ROUTING
- Public routes should be SEO-friendly:
  /{culture}/services
  /{culture}/services/{slug}
  /{culture}/projects
  /{culture}/projects/{slug}
  /{culture}/blog
  /{culture}/blog/{slug}
  /{culture}/p/{slug} (CMS pages)
- Culture segment optional if you prefer cookie-based; BUT still support explicit culture in URL or provide redirect.

ADMIN AREA
- /Admin
- Must include:
  - Login/Logout
  - Role-based authorization
  - CRUD screens with Bootstrap forms, server validation, list paging/filtering
  - Consistent layout: sidebar + topbar
  - Confirm modals for deletes
  - Avoid accidental data loss

IIS DEPLOYMENT NOTES (MUST INCLUDE IN README)
- Provide web.config if needed (ASP.NET Core hosting bundle)
- Ensure DB is writable by IIS app pool identity in publish folder
- Explain where DB file lives in published environment
- Explain how to run migrations in Production (dotnet ef database update or bundled migration runner)

WORKFLOW YOU MUST FOLLOW
1) Propose the folder structure + NuGet packages + localization strategy (A or B).
2) Implement Domain + EF Core + migrations.
3) Implement sanitizer + URL validator + tests first (security gate).
4) Implement auth (local user table + cookie).
5) Implement Admin area CRUD for all entities.
6) Implement public pages and routing with sanitized rendering.
7) Implement SEO/meta, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, search.
8) Verify build and run. Fix every compile/runtime error.

DELIVERABLES
- A complete Visual Studio solution under /src that builds successfully.
- All required pages and admin CRUD working end-to-end.
- README with:
  - prerequisites
  - how to run
  - how to login admin (dev seeding)
  - migrations
  - publish/IIS deployment and DB permissions
- Final validation checklist with the URLs you tested.

DO NOT
- Do not add generators/scaffolding output as an end product.
- Do not leave TODOs that break build.
- Do not skip sanitization or tests.
- Do not add file upload.
- Do not use any JS frameworks beyond jQuery and Bootstrap.
- Do not use data/blob protocols anywhere.
