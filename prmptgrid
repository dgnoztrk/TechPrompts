You are a senior .NET architect and senior full-stack developer. You will UPDATE an existing ASP.NET Core Website Generator project to meet production quality, WITHOUT rewriting from scratch and WITHOUT breaking existing logic.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Fix the current project so that it compiles cleanly, CRUD flows work end-to-end, all missing references are corrected, and cshtml views render without runtime errors. Preserve the existing architecture, data model, and generator logic as much as possible. Then polish UX/UI for internal pages (especially Contact) using Bootstrap + jQuery.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
1) DO NOT redesign the whole system. Keep the existing structure and intent. Prefer small, targeted fixes.
2) Do not change public routes/contracts unless required to fix a broken flow. If changed, add backward-compatible redirects or aliases.
3) Do not remove features. If something is incomplete, finish it in the existing style.
4) Fix must be consistent: controllers, viewmodels, views, EF models, validation, and mappings must match.
5) When you add new code, follow current naming conventions and folder structure.
6) Prefer strongly-typed views and correct Model binding. Avoid “magic ViewBag” unless already used.

WORK PLAN (FOLLOW IN ORDER)

A) BASELINE HEALTH CHECK
- Open the solution and build it. Identify all compile errors and warnings.
- Run the app and hit the broken pages / CRUD screens to capture runtime exceptions (null refs, missing view models, incorrect view paths, missing using/imports, etc.).
- Create a checklist of issues grouped by:
  1) Missing ViewModels / DTOs
  2) ManageController CRUD gaps (Create/Edit/Delete/List/Details)
  3) Razor (.cshtml) binding errors and missing @model / wrong property names
  4) Routing/Action mismatch, broken links in views
  5) EF Core issues (missing migrations, wrong includes, lazy loading assumptions, missing navigation props)
  6) Missing static assets/layout issues (broken bundles, wrong paths)

B) VIEWMODEL COMPLETION & CONSISTENCY
- For each CRUD entity used by ManageController and views, ensure there is a complete set of ViewModels:
  - ListItem VM (for index table/grid)
  - Detail VM
  - Create VM
  - Edit VM
  - Optional: DeleteConfirm VM
- Ensure ViewModels reflect actual entity properties and required validation attributes.
- Add mappings (manual mapping or existing pattern) so controller actions use VMs consistently.
- Ensure multi-language fields / image paths / flags (e.g., ShowOnHome/IsFeatured) are present if the UI expects them. If the UI references a property, it MUST exist and be mapped.

C) MANAGECONTROLLER CRUD FIXES (TARGETED)
- Audit every action in ManageController:
  - Index: paging/sorting if present; fix null refs; ensure includes for related data.
  - Create (GET/POST): fix model binding, validation, and persistence; handle failure re-render with correct VM data (dropdowns/tags/etc).
  - Edit (GET/POST): correctly load entity by id, map to VM, update only intended fields, handle concurrency if already present.
  - Details: load entity with required relations and render correct VM.
  - Delete (GET/POST): confirm page and safe delete behavior consistent with existing logic.
- Fix any missing actions or mismatched view names.
- Fix anti-forgery and validation: POST actions must validate ModelState and rehydrate required reference lists.
- Ensure all return View(...) calls point to existing cshtml and correct model types.

D) RAZOR (.CSHTML) REPAIR & REFERENCE FIXES
- For each cshtml with errors:
  - Correct the @model declaration to the right ViewModel type.
  - Fix property name mismatches (rename references or adjust VM).
  - Fix broken partials/components and ensure they receive correct model.
  - Fix form tag helpers (asp-action/asp-controller/asp-route-id) to match actual actions.
  - Fix client-side validation script references if broken.
- Ensure layout references (CSS/JS) exist and paths are correct.
- Remove dead/incorrect links in navigation menus that point to non-existing routes.

E) DATA ACCESS & EF CORE RELIABILITY
- Verify DbContext sets and relationships align with what controllers and views need.
- Add missing includes for relations used in views (avoid lazy loading assumptions unless configured).
- Ensure migrations are in sync; if needed create a migration that minimally fixes schema issues (do NOT drop data).
- Fix seeding if it crashes or produces invalid references.

F) UX/UI POLISHING (BOOTSTRAP + JQUERY, NO REWRITE)
Goal: make internal pages (especially Contact) look premium with minimal code changes:
- Keep existing layout, but improve sections using Bootstrap components:
  - Contact page: hero header, contact cards (phone/email/address), office hours, social links, map placeholder, and a clean form layout.
  - Add consistent spacing, typography hierarchy, and responsive grids.
- Improve forms:
  - Inline validation summary, field hints, proper input groups/icons where appropriate.
  - Use Bootstrap validation styles; ensure unobtrusive validation works.
- Improve admin CRUD pages:
  - Better table spacing, action buttons, empty state messages, confirm dialogs (Bootstrap modal) for delete.
  - Consistent breadcrumbs and page headers.
- Ensure all improvements are compatible with current theme/assets and do not introduce new heavy dependencies.

G) QUALITY GATES (MUST PASS BEFORE FINISH)
- Solution builds with zero compile errors.
- Manual smoke tests:
  - For each CRUD module: Create -> List -> Details -> Edit -> Delete works.
  - Views render without runtime exceptions.
  - No broken cshtml references/partials.
- No regression to existing generator logic: site generation still functions as before.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Commit-style changes: explain what was fixed in:
  1) ViewModels added/updated
  2) ManageController fixes per entity
  3) cshtml fixes (which views)
  4) UX improvements (which pages/sections)
- Keep changes minimal and consistent with existing patterns.

IMPORTANT: Preserve the current project’s intent and structure. Fix missing references, missing models, broken CRUD, and cshtml errors. Then improve UX for inner pages (especially Contact) using Bootstrap + jQuery.
