You are a principal-level .NET 10 engineer. Build a production-grade Website Generator as a .NET 10 Console application. The generator produces a .NET 10 ASP.NET Core MVC monolithic corporate website. This is a template-driven scaffolder: every generated file must originate from a .txt template and be created by placeholder replacement.

Non-negotiable Constraints

.NET 10 for generator + generated project.

Generated solution contains exactly one MVC project (no extra class libraries, no layered architecture).

DB is SQLite + EF Core.

SQLite .db file must be inside the generated web project root.

Localization:

Default language tr (Turkish), optional switch to en (English).

Language switcher in top-right.

UI texts from JSON files:

Langs/tr.json

Langs/en.json

Keys are strict identifiers: [A-Za-z0-9_]+ only (no spaces, no Turkish chars, no symbols).

Content is multilingual in the database:

Products/blog/portfolio/pages/sliders must have translation tables keyed by LanguageCode (tr, en).

JSON language files are only for UI chrome (menus, labels, buttons, etc.), not for content.

Admin:

Single controller: ManagementController for all admin operations, including login.

/manage route shows login if not authenticated.

Admin pages use _AdminLayout.cshtml, public pages use _Layout.cshtml.

Cookie auth, anti-forgery in forms.

First run:

If no admin exists, seed default admin admin/admin (store hashed password, never plaintext).

Themes:

Only CSS themes, at least 8 theme files in wwwroot/themes/.

Default: light.css.

Theme selection persisted in DB, changeable in admin.

Admin can save CustomCss and CustomJs in DB; layouts inject them.

Template-first generation:

Generator stores templates in Templates/.

Templates are .txt and later saved as real file extension.

Images (demo assets) are copied as binary.

Naming:

User enters a company/site name in console.

Generate SolutionName and ProjectName: ASCII-only, no spaces, no special chars, no Turkish chars.

Use a deterministic normalization algorithm (document it + implement it).

UI:

Bootstrap + jQuery.

Corporate design; clean HTML; responsive.

SEO:

robots.txt, sitemap.xml (initially static ok, but architecture must allow dynamic later).

meta tags, OpenGraph basics, canonical.

Razor keyword collisions:

Avoid property/variable names conflicting with Razor keywords (e.g., page, model, etc.). Use safe names like SitePageEntity, PageVm, etc.

Output Requirements (Strict)

You must output everything in phases. Each phase must end with a “Quality Gate Checklist” and “How to run” instructions. If you cannot fit all code in one response, you must still finish Phase 1 fully compile-ready, and then continue Phase 2, 3, 4 in the same answer (condensed but complete). Do not ask questions; make sensible defaults.

Do not produce partial files. For each file you mention, you must output its full contents.

Phase Structure

Phase 0: Final architecture summary + design decisions (why).

Phase 1: Generator skeleton + template engine + project scaffolding + minimal generated MVC that runs.

Phase 2: EF Core models + DbContext + migrations strategy + DataSeed + authentication.

Phase 3: Public pages + admin CRUD pages + theme system + custom css/js + language switch.

Phase 4: SEO assets + slugging + validations + polish + testability notes.

Phase 0 — Architecture & Decisions

Provide:

High-level architecture diagram in text.

File/folder tree (Generator + Templates + Generated project).

Decisions with rationale:

Translation table approach

JSON UI text provider

Cookie auth strategy

Seeding approach

Theme loading strategy

Template mapping approach

Quality Gate for Phase 0:

Every requirement mapped to a component/file.

No extra projects/layers.

Phase 1 — Generator Skeleton + Template Engine + Minimal MVC Output
1.1 Generator Project

Create a .NET 10 Console project named WebsiteGenerator.

Generator responsibilities:

Interactive CLI:

Ask CompanyName

Ask output directory

Ask theme selection (from available theme templates)

Ask “Seed demo data?” default Yes

Ask “Include EN language?” default Yes (still keep tr base always)

Create solution and MVC project using dotnet CLI:

dotnet new sln

dotnet new mvc

dotnet sln add

Apply templates:

Overwrite scaffolded files with templated versions.

Template engine:

Replace placeholders: {{SolutionName}}, {{ProjectName}}, {{CompanyName}}, {{CompanyNameSafe}}, {{DefaultTheme}}, {{IncludeEnglish}}, {{SeedDemoData}}

Validate leftover tokens: fail if any {{...}} remains.

File mapping:

Templates/WebProject/... mirrors output tree.

.txt becomes final extension (strip .txt).

Copy binary assets from Templates/WebProject/wwwroot/assets/demo/* without text replacement.

Name sanitizer:

Turkish char to Latin mapping (ğ->g, ü->u, ş->s, ı->i, ö->o, ç->c)

Strip other diacritics

Remove non-alphanumeric

PascalCase or “safe” style

Ensure not empty; fallback Site

Ensure starts with letter; if not, prefix Site

Logging:

Basic console logger with levels.

You must output these generator files fully:

WebsiteGenerator/Program.cs

WebsiteGenerator/GeneratorOptions.cs

WebsiteGenerator/Services/TemplateEngine.cs

WebsiteGenerator/Services/ScaffoldService.cs

WebsiteGenerator/Services/DotnetCli.cs

WebsiteGenerator/Services/NameSanitizer.cs

WebsiteGenerator/Services/FileSystem.cs

WebsiteGenerator/WebsiteGenerator.csproj

1.2 Minimal Generated MVC Project (must run)

Phase 1 generated project must compile and run with:

Home page showing company name and theme loaded.

Language switcher changes UI labels using JSON provider (Phase 1 can include provider skeleton).

SQLite configured (db file created) but full models may come Phase 2.

You must output templates for critical minimal runtime:

Templates/WebProject/{{ProjectName}}.csproj.txt

Templates/WebProject/Program.cs.txt

Templates/WebProject/appsettings.json.txt

Templates/WebProject/Controllers/HomeController.cs.txt

Templates/WebProject/Views/Home/Index.cshtml.txt

Templates/WebProject/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml.txt

Templates/WebProject/Views/_ViewImports.cshtml.txt

Templates/WebProject/Views/_ViewStart.cshtml.txt

Templates/WebProject/Langs/tr.json.txt

Templates/WebProject/Langs/en.json.txt

Templates/WebProject/wwwroot/themes/light.css.txt

plus 7 more theme css templates (phase 1 can ship them even if phase 3 enhances)

Templates/WebProject/wwwroot/robots.txt.txt

Templates/WebProject/wwwroot/sitemap.xml.txt

Also include a minimal TextProvider for JSON UI strings:

Templates/WebProject/Services/TextProvider.cs.txt

Templates/WebProject/Extensions/TextProviderExtensions.cs.txt

Razor helper usage: @T["Navbar_Home"]

Quality Gate for Phase 1:

After generation:

dotnet restore

dotnet run
works.

Theme CSS loads.

Language switcher changes navbar label.

No leftover tokens.

Phase 2 — EF Core + Authentication + Seeding

Implement the full data model with translation tables.

2.1 Entities (in generated MVC)

Implement these entities (single project, e.g., Models/Entities/):

SiteSetting (ThemeName, CustomCss, CustomJs, DefaultLanguage)

AdminUser (Username, PasswordHash, PasswordSalt OR use PasswordHasher)

Slider, SliderTranslation

Product, ProductTranslation

BlogPost, BlogPostTranslation

PortfolioItem, PortfolioItemTranslation

SitePage, SitePageTranslation

Optional: MediaAsset table for future (but keep minimal)

All translations have LanguageCode constrained to tr/en.

2.2 DbContext

AppDbContext with Fluent API:

Unique constraints:

AdminUser.Username unique

SitePage.Slug unique

Translation unique composite: (EntityId, LanguageCode)

Cascade behavior appropriate.

SQLite connection string to point to ./app.db (project root).

Migrations:

Choose one:

(Preferred) ship migrations templates and instruct dotnet ef database update

or EnsureCreated() for simplicity in early stage (but explain trade-offs).

Pick one and implement consistently.

2.3 DataSeed

Runs on startup.

If no admin exists:

create default admin admin/admin (hashed)

seed:

2 sliders + translations

3 products + translations + images

2 blog posts + translations + images

2 portfolios + translations + images

site settings with selected theme

Demo images are from wwwroot/assets/demo/ (must exist).

2.4 Authentication

Cookie Authentication with claims.

Login in ManagementController:

GET /manage -> login if not authenticated

POST -> validate credentials, sign in

logout endpoint

Protect admin routes with [Authorize] or manual check.

You must output templates for:

Entities + DbContext + Seed + Auth config in Program.cs

ManagementController skeleton (full in Phase 3 but login must work now)

Quality Gate for Phase 2:

Fresh DB created and seeded automatically.

Login works with admin/admin.

Admin area access requires auth.

Phase 3 — Pages + CRUD + Theme + Custom CSS/JS + Multilingual DB Content
3.1 Public Pages

Implement controllers/views:

Home (slider + featured products/blog/portfolio)

Products list + detail (slug route)

Blog list + detail

Portfolio list + detail

Contact page

About/Mission/Vision as seeded SitePages with fixed slugs

Dynamic pages: /p/{slug}

All listing and detail views must query translations by current language (cookie) with fallback to tr if missing.

3.2 Admin (ManagementController only)

Within ManagementController, implement areas logically by action groups:

Dashboard

Products: list/create/edit/delete

Blog: list/create/edit/delete

Portfolio: list/create/edit/delete

Sliders: list/create/edit/delete + sort order + active

Pages: list/create/edit/delete + slug edit + content editor

Site settings:

Theme selection dropdown

Custom CSS textarea

Custom JS textarea

Default language (still tr base)

For each CRUD:

handle translations in same form (tabs for TR/EN)

image upload (basic) OR choose from demo for now; pick one approach and implement.

Use Bootstrap admin theme layout (sidebar).

Use anti-forgery tokens.

Quality Gate for Phase 3:

CRUD works end-to-end.

Multilingual entries saved and shown correctly.

Theme switching immediately affects public layout.

Phase 4 — SEO, Slugging, Validation, Robustness
4.1 Slug Service

Slugify method:

Turkish normalization

lowercase

hyphen

uniqueness for products/blog/portfolio/pages (append -2 etc.)

Routes:

/products/{slug}

/blog/{slug}

/portfolio/{slug}

/p/{slug}

4.2 SEO

robots.txt and sitemap.xml included.

Add canonical and OpenGraph in layout.

Add basic structured data placeholder (JSON-LD) optional.

4.3 Validation & Security

Server-side validation (DataAnnotations).

Prevent XSS in stored HTML where applicable:

Either store plain text + render encoded OR allow HTML with explicit note.

Choose a safe default: render encoded; allow limited HTML later.

Add CSP note for custom JS.

Quality Gate for Phase 4:

No broken links.

Slugs unique.

Layout meta tags exist.

Admin forms protected.

Final Output Format

You must output:

The full folder tree for generator and templates.

Then file-by-file content blocks. Each block must start with:
// File: <relative path>

Provide exactly one cohesive solution. No pseudocode. No “TODO later”.

Ensure compilation.

Now implement Phase 0 to Phase 4 in one response, ensuring Phase 1 and Phase 2 are definitely compile-ready. If length is a problem, compress Phase 3/4 views but they still must be complete and compilable.
