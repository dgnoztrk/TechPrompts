Build ONE specific corporate website application (public site + admin CMS) using ASP.NET Core MVC targeting .NET 10 (use the latest installed stable .NET 10 SDK/TargetFramework available), EF Core, and SQLite. 
Deliver a single runnable corporate website for ONE company. This is not a platform and must not create other websites.

ABSOLUTE SCOPE GUARDRAILS
- Build exactly one corporate website app (public + admin management).
- DO NOT implement anything that creates other sites/projects/templates.
- DO NOT introduce any “builder/scaffolding/template engine/create site” concepts.
- DO NOT use MVC Areas. No /Areas folder, no Area routing.
- Admin management must be implemented via a single controller named ManageController, and ALL CRUD operations must be inside it.
- Do NOT create additional CRUD controllers for those entities. Only ManageController for CRUD.
- If your plan/code violates any of the above, delete that approach and implement correctly.

SOLUTION STRUCTURE (Clean Architecture - EXACT)
Create a Visual Studio solution with exactly 4 projects, all targeting .NET 10:
1) Domain (Class Library) - entities, enums, domain rules
2) Application (Class Library) - use cases/services, DTOs/ViewModels, validation, interfaces
3) Infrastructure (Class Library) - EF Core DbContext, mappings, repositories, implementations, auth helpers (as needed)
4) Web (ASP.NET Core MVC) - controllers, views, wwwroot, composition root (DI), localization, auth cookie config
No other projects. No extra layers. Keep dependencies correct:
- Domain has no references.
- Application references Domain only.
- Infrastructure references Application + Domain.
- Web references Application + Infrastructure + Domain.

TECH REQUIREMENTS
- .NET 10 ASP.NET Core MVC
- EF Core (latest stable) + SQLite provider (latest stable)
- Bootstrap 5 (latest stable) + jQuery (latest stable) via CDN ONLY
- Theme: single theme file only: /wwwroot/css/light.css (polished corporate look, minimal but high quality)
- Admin editor: Summernote (WYSIWYG) integrated in admin forms
- NuGet packages must be latest STABLE versions (not preview). Keep a list in README.

DEPLOYMENT TARGET
- IIS (include publish notes, web.config when appropriate, and DB file permissions guidance)

LOCALIZATION
- tr-TR, en-US, ru-RU across public site and management UI
- Use RequestLocalization + .resx resource files
- Provide a language switcher (public navbar + management topbar)
- Culture via cookie, and also support explicit culture in URL segments

DATABASE / SQLITE PATHING (CRITICAL)
- SQLite DB file:
  - Development: stored in the project root (same folder as Web.csproj)
  - Published/IIS: stored in the publish folder (AppContext.BaseDirectory)
- Implement a robust DbPathResolver in Infrastructure (or Web composition root) that:
  - Detects dev vs published reliably
  - Produces a consistent absolute path
- Auto-migrate only in Development; in Production give manual migration steps and log schema mismatch hints.

AUTH (NO ASP.NET IDENTITY)
- Implement local user table + cookie auth:
  - LocalUser: Id, Username, PasswordHash, PasswordSalt (PBKDF2 recommended), Role (Admin/Editor), IsActive, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
- Use cookie auth + claims.
- Management endpoints require authenticated user; Users/Settings are Admin-only.
- Seed a dev admin user using appsettings.Development.json or environment variables (never hardcode).

PUBLIC SITE (must implement)
Pages:
- Home
- About
- Services (list + detail)
- Projects/Portfolio (list + detail)
- Blog/News (list + detail)
- Contact (writes to DB only; no SMTP now)
- Privacy / KVKK
- Search (site-wide search across published Pages/Blog/Services/Projects with paging)

Routing & SEO:
- SEO-friendly slug routes with culture:
  /{culture}/services
  /{culture}/services/{slug}
  /{culture}/projects
  /{culture}/projects/{slug}
  /{culture}/blog
  /{culture}/blog/{slug}
  /{culture}/p/{slug}
- Meta title/description per content, OpenGraph on detail pages, canonical URL
- sitemap.xml + robots.txt

UI/UX:
- Bootstrap responsive layout: navbar/footer, hero sections, cards, good typography
- Keep custom CSS only in light.css (clean corporate aesthetic)
- Implement proper validation UI, accessible markup, consistent spacing.

MANAGEMENT (ADMIN) - WITHOUT AREAS, SINGLE ManageController
- Create ManageController (e.g., route prefix /manage or /admin, but still no Areas).
- ALL CRUD must be implemented inside ManageController.
- Use explicit action naming or route tokens to separate modules cleanly.
  Example pattern (choose one and implement consistently):
  - /manage/pages (list)
  - /manage/pages/create
  - /manage/pages/edit/{id}
  - /manage/pages/delete/{id}
  - /manage/pages/details/{id}
  Similarly for posts, services, projects, categories, tags, settings, users, contact-messages.
- Provide complete CRUD views for every module:
  - Index (list with paging/filtering/sorting)
  - Create
  - Edit
  - Details
  - Delete (confirm)
- Provide dashboard view: counts for messages, drafts, published items.
- Add filtering:
  - by publish status, category, tag, language/culture where relevant.
- Provide ordering management for Services/Projects (SortOrder).

ENTITIES (baseline)
Implement these domain entities (adjust but keep features):
- Category: Id, Name, Slug, Type (Blog/Service/Project), SortOrder, IsActive
- Tag: Id, Name, Slug
- Page: Id, localized fields depending on strategy, Title, HtmlContent, IsPublished, SeoTitle, SeoDescription, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
- BlogPost: Id, Title, Summary, HtmlContent, CoverImageUrl (remote only), IsPublished, PublishedAt, Categories M2M, Tags M2M, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
- Service: Id, Title, ShortDescription, HtmlContent, IconCssClass, IsPublished, SortOrder, Categories M2M, Tags M2M, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
- Project: Id, Title, Summary, HtmlContent, CoverImageUrl (remote only), IsPublished, SortOrder, Categories M2M, Tags M2M, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
- SiteSetting: Id, Key, Value, Group
- ContactMessage: Id, Name, Email, Subject, Message, CreatedAt, Status (New/InProgress/Closed), AdminNote
- LocalUser: described above

LOCALIZED CONTENT STRATEGY (pick and implement fully)
Pick ONE and document it:
Option A: Per entity, store localized fields in a separate table:
  - PageTranslation / BlogPostTranslation / ServiceTranslation / ProjectTranslation with Culture, Title, HtmlContent, SeoTitle, SeoDescription, Slug
Option B: Single table with SlugTr/SlugEn/SlugRu etc. (less clean, but acceptable if done consistently)
Prefer Option A for cleanliness and scalability.

WYSIWYG + SECURITY (CRITICAL)
- Use Summernote in management Create/Edit forms for HtmlContent.
- Persist raw HTML but render sanitized HTML on public pages.

SERVER-SIDE HTML SANITIZATION + TESTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Implement sanitizer and unit tests (in Web or a small test setup under the same solution if allowed; but since only 4 projects allowed, implement tests as a simple internal test harness or use a minimal approach in Web with a test mode — still must be runnable and documented).
Rules:
- Disallow: script, iframe, object, embed, style
- Remove ALL inline style attributes and ALL on* event handlers
- Allow <img> but remote only:
  - src must be http/https only
  - forbid data: and blob:
  - only allow attributes: src, alt, title
  - invalid src => remove entire img tag
- Allow <a> with href http/https only; add rel="noopener noreferrer"
- Allow basic formatting tags: p, br, strong, em, ul, ol, li, h1-h6, blockquote, code, pre (optional safe tables)
- Implement RemoteUrlValidator used for cover images, img src, logo/social URLs in settings.

CODE QUALITY / RELIABILITY
- Async EF Core everywhere.
- Never bind EF entities directly in POST actions; always use ViewModels.
- Add anti-forgery for all POST.
- Add global exception handling + error pages.
- Add structured logging.
- Add optimistic concurrency handling (UpdatedAt check or RowVersion) to prevent lost updates.
- Ensure no null reference issues: default values + validation + defensive coding.

CDN REQUIREMENTS
- Use reputable CDN (jsDelivr) and include integrity/crossorigin when available.
- Put references in shared layout once (_Layout.cshtml), used by public and management pages.
- Add light.css after Bootstrap.

DELIVERABLES
- A complete solution that builds and runs.
- No missing views. All CRUD views exist and are wired.
- README includes:
  - prerequisites (.NET 10)
  - how to run
  - how dev admin seeding works
  - EF migrations instructions
  - IIS publish steps + DB permission note + where DB lives in publish
  - which NuGet packages and versions are used (latest stable)

IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW (must keep build green)
1) Create solution + projects + references per rules.
2) Implement Domain entities + translation strategy.
3) Implement Infrastructure DbContext + migrations + SQLite path resolver.
4) Implement auth (local user + cookie) and seeding.
5) Implement sanitizer + URL validator and document/test with malicious samples.
6) Implement public controllers/views + routing.
7) Implement ManageController + ALL CRUD modules + all views.
8) Verify: build, run, login, create/edit/publish content, browse public pages in TR/EN/RU, contact form writes to DB, sitemap/robots exist.

STOP CONDITIONS
- If you accidentally introduce Areas or multiple CRUD controllers, remove them and re-implement with a single ManageController and no Areas.
- If you drift into building something that creates other websites, delete that and build a normal corporate website.
